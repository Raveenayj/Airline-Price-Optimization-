# Airline-Price-Optimization-
Raveena Mehta, Joseph Scheidt, Meghana Masudi
This is our final project for course EE-608A
We have optimized the revenue acquired from airline business, which is beneficial to their business growth.
We do so by, setting up the ticket prices and thus, optimizing the revenue based on their relation with pricing of tickets.
We have used the equation: revenue= price * tickets sold
 
We have used a simulator python file  for defining the main functions and an another optimization code 
The input code is the sol.py whereas the simulator code is  mysim.py
I have also uploaded the ppt file for better understanding of the logic used in our code.
